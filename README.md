## About

Built a project for Decent using NextJS framework together with the libraries listed below. NextJS is using page routing so split up each page into a separate file. Then I broke down the mockups into smaller components that were commonly shared between the mockups.

The page is using MirageJS to stub the API, and then I keep track of the user inside the React Context store that is shared between the pages.

### Libaries used:

- NextJS
- Formik
- Yup
- Typescript
- Jest
- React Testing Library
- TailwindCSS
- MirageJS
